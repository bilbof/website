        p Hello, my name is Bill. I work as a software engineer at the Government Digital Service (GDS).
        p Prior to GDS I worked at ChartMogul. Before this I worked for a cybersecurity organisation, and the world's largest publisher. In my spare time I study Software Engineering at Oxford University.
        p I have professional experience with modern front-end development, Node.js, Ruby, and Go, in addition to SQL and NoSQL databases. During my studies I mainly wrote Java and Python.
        p I enjoy rowing, and captained Christ Church college's Men's 3rd boat for Summer VIII's 2018.
